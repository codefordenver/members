#### So you'd like to contribute? Great!

Here is what you need to know:

This project uses [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) where updates are made on feature branches. Pull requests are submitted on those branches and reviewed before being merged.

**If you have write access to the repo**, we prefer you use branches in the main repo rather than your own fork as they are easier to manage and easier to collaborate on.
