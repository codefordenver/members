# Welcome to Code for Denver

We're glad you're here! ðŸ˜ƒ

Here are some getting started steps we'd love for you to follow:
1. [Review the information on your profile](/me/edit) and make sure it is correct.
2. Make sure you get invited to our Flowdock organization (you'll need to talk to someone who has access)
3. Peruse the links we've provided below to learn about the organization and what tools we use
4. Help us with a project (We're a very project-oriented group, so we'd like to direct you to working on one)
    - Look through the [projects we are currently working on](/projects) and see if you're interested in joining any of them
    - Read [this document on how to contribute to a project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p3oehpGhFGLjorp6_T83BXdouPET62LqJFlOEJWEtq0)
