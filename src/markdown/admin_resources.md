For adding people to Flowdock, you can use [this page](/admin/onboarding) to get a list of people that signed up in the last week.

For creating new projects go to: [/projects/create](/projects/create)
> Technically anyone can do this right now, but we haven't made the url discoverable because we haven't figured out how we want to handle that yet
